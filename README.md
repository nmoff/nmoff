Hey im Nate, im interested in all manner of things engineering and science [specifically computer science] and im looking to collaborate on various in class activities and group projects. You can reach me with my email: nmoff1@ocdsb.ca
As of now i can solve the :
- Corner Twisting pyraminx
- Variations of the Pyraminx
- Pyraminx Duo
- Pyraminx [Actual]
I use a variety of methods but it basically comes down to in in out out and screwing around until it works.
Most often my times ranged from a minute to 5 minutes, with the pyraminx,  and proportionately smaller times for the ther pyramids.
